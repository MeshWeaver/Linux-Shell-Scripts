Hi there,

Just a quick note about these scripts - chances are, most of these are created through experimentation and are
often based off of several lines of code found throughout various Linux forums. Unfortunately I haven't been
keeping track of the various "contributors" and sources, so I just want to extend a thank-you to those people
who took the time to post the various lines of code on various websites.
